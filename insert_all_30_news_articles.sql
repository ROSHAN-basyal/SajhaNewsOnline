('Nepal Economy Projected to Grow 4.5% in FY25, World Bank Reports', 'Economic growth expected to improve from 3.9% in FY24, with services sector driving recovery and merchandise imports boosting trade.', 'The World Bank projects Nepal''s economy will grow by 4.5 percent in FY25, representing an improvement from the 3.9 percent growth recorded in FY24, with continued acceleration expected in subsequent years.

The projection indicates Nepal''s economy will average 5.4 percent annual growth in FY26-FY27, demonstrating sustained recovery momentum following post-pandemic challenges and policy adjustments.

Growth Drivers:
- Services sector leading economic expansion
- Recovery in merchandise imports boosting trade
- Wholesale and retail trade stimulation
